Production Engineering Module

This module contains functions related to oil and gas production analysis and calculations.
Currently serves as a testing module with basic functions, but is intended to expand
with comprehensive production engineering tools for rate analysis, decline curve analysis,
well performance evaluation, and production optimization calculations.

Functions:
    test_func: Simple test function returning a greeting message
    
Notes:
    This module is under development and will be expanded with additional production
    engineering functions including:
    - Production decline analysis
    - Well performance evaluation  
    - Rate transient analysis
    - Production optimization
    - Economic analysis tools

def test_func():
    """
    Simple test function that returns a greeting message.
    
    This is a basic test function used for module validation and testing purposes.
    It serves as a placeholder while the production module is under development
    and will be expanded with more comprehensive production engineering functions.
    
    Returns:
        str: A simple greeting message "Hello, World!"
        
    Examples:
        >>> test_func()
        'Hello, World!'
        
        >>> message = test_func()
        >>> print(message)
        Hello, World!
    
    Notes:
        - This function requires no parameters
        - Primarily used for testing module imports and basic functionality
        - Will be supplemented with more sophisticated production analysis functions
