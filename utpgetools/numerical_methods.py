Numerical Methods Module

This module is designed to contain numerical methods and computational tools
commonly used in petroleum engineering calculations. These methods provide
robust solutions for complex mathematical problems that arise in reservoir
simulation, well testing, production optimization, and other petroleum
engineering applications.

Intended Functions (Under Development):
    - Root finding algorithms (Newton-Raphson, bisection, secant methods)
    - Numerical integration techniques (trapezoidal, Simpson's rule, Gaussian quadrature)
    - Ordinary differential equation solvers (Runge-Kutta, Euler methods)
    - Partial differential equation solvers for reservoir simulation
    - Matrix operations and linear algebra utilities
    - Optimization algorithms (least squares, gradient descent, genetic algorithms)
    - Interpolation and extrapolation methods (spline, polynomial, rational functions)
    - Curve fitting and regression analysis
    - Monte Carlo simulation and statistical sampling
    - Finite difference and finite element methods

Applications:
    - Reservoir simulation and modeling
    - Well test analysis and interpretation
    - Production decline curve analysis
    - Economic optimization and decision analysis
    - Uncertainty quantification and risk assessment
    - Material balance calculations
    - Heat transfer and thermodynamic calculations
    - Fluid flow in porous media

Dependencies (Planned):
    - numpy: For numerical calculations and linear algebra
    - scipy: For advanced numerical methods and optimization
    - matplotlib: For visualization of numerical results
    - numba: For high-performance numerical computing
    - sympy: For symbolic mathematics and analytical solutions

Notes:
    This module is currently under development. Functions will be added to provide
    robust numerical solutions for petroleum engineering problems, with emphasis
    on accuracy, efficiency, and numerical stability.
    
    The module will include comprehensive error checking, convergence analysis,
    and validation against analytical solutions where available.
