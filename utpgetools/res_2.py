Reservoir Engineering Module (Extended)

This module is designed to contain advanced reservoir engineering functions
and calculations that extend beyond basic reservoir analysis. The module
focuses on sophisticated reservoir characterization, enhanced oil recovery,
and advanced production analysis techniques.

Intended Functions (Under Development):
    - Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) analysis and design
    - Waterflooding and gas injection performance prediction
    - Steamflood and thermal recovery calculations
    - Chemical flooding (polymer, surfactant, alkaline) analysis
    - Reservoir simulation input/output processing
    - Advanced material balance calculations
    - Compartmentalization analysis
    - Aquifer modeling and water influx calculations
    - Gas cap expansion and solution gas drive analysis
    - Fractured reservoir modeling (dual porosity, discrete fracture networks)
    - Well interference and drainage area calculations
    - Reserve estimation using probabilistic methods

Applications:
    - Field development planning and optimization
    - Enhanced oil recovery project evaluation
    - Reservoir management and performance monitoring
    - Secondary and tertiary recovery design
    - Production forecasting and decline analysis
    - Economic evaluation of development scenarios
    - Risk assessment and uncertainty quantification
    - Integrated reservoir-wellbore-facilities modeling

Dependencies (Planned):
    - numpy: For numerical calculations and array operations
    - scipy: For optimization and statistical analysis
    - matplotlib: For reservoir data visualization
    - pandas: For production data analysis
    - scikit-learn: For machine learning applications in reservoir engineering

Notes:
    This module is currently under development and will complement the existing
    reservoir engineering tools in the utpgetools package. Functions will be
    added to support advanced reservoir analysis workflows and enhanced recovery
    processes.
    
    The module will implement industry-standard correlations and methods with
    comprehensive validation against field data and published case studies.
