Geostatistics Module

This module is designed to contain functions for geostatistical analysis and
spatial modeling of petroleum reservoir properties. Geostatistics provides
tools for characterizing spatial variability and uncertainty in reservoir
properties such as porosity, permeability, and fluid saturations.

Intended Functions (Under Development):
    - Variogram analysis and modeling (experimental and theoretical variograms)
    - Kriging interpolation methods (ordinary, simple, universal kriging)
    - Sequential Gaussian simulation for uncertainty quantification
    - Indicator kriging for facies modeling
    - Co-kriging for multi-variable spatial analysis
    - Trend analysis and detrending
    - Spatial continuity analysis
    - Cross-validation and model validation
    - Anisotropy analysis and modeling
    - Data conditioning and transformation

Applications:
    - Reservoir property mapping and interpolation
    - Uncertainty quantification in reservoir models
    - Optimal well placement and development planning
    - History matching and model calibration
    - Risk assessment for field development
    - Facies modeling and geological characterization
    - Production optimization under uncertainty

Dependencies (Planned):
    - numpy: For numerical calculations and array operations
    - scipy: For statistical analysis and optimization
    - matplotlib: For spatial data visualization
    - scikit-learn: For machine learning and clustering
    - pandas: For data handling and manipulation

Notes:
    This module is currently under development. Functions will be added to support
    comprehensive geostatistical workflows including variogram modeling, kriging
    interpolation, and conditional simulation techniques.
    
    The module will implement industry-standard geostatistical algorithms and
    include validation against synthetic and real reservoir datasets.
