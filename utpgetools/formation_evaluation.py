Formation Evaluation Module

This module is designed to contain functions and tools for formation evaluation
and petrophysical analysis in petroleum engineering. Formation evaluation is
the process of determining reservoir rock and fluid properties from well logs,
core data, and other geological and geophysical measurements.

Intended Functions (Under Development):
    - Well log analysis and interpretation
    - Porosity calculations from various log types (neutron, density, sonic)
    - Water saturation calculations using Archie's equation and other methods
    - Permeability estimation from porosity and lithology
    - Net-to-gross ratio calculations
    - Pay zone identification and characterization
    - Rock typing and facies analysis
    - Clay volume calculations
    - Formation factor and resistivity index analysis

Applications:
    - Reservoir characterization and modeling
    - Completion design and optimization
    - Production forecasting and decline analysis
    - Reserve estimation and evaluation
    - Drilling hazard identification
    - Geosteering and real-time formation evaluation

Dependencies (Planned):
    - numpy: For numerical calculations
    - matplotlib: For log plotting and visualization
    - scipy: For statistical analysis and curve fitting
    - pandas: For data handling and manipulation

Notes:
    This module is currently under development. Functions will be added to support
    comprehensive formation evaluation workflows including log analysis, core-log
    integration, and petrophysical property calculations.
    
    The module will follow industry-standard practices and include validation
    against well-known datasets and published correlations.
